  BDSM Project ~ S{cripting,ystem,tack} Management (SM) Framework

%hr
%h2
  Introduction

%p
  "BDSM Project"


%h2 What It Is

%p
  The SM framework is a powerful new framework for developing, maintaining and
  sharing system scripts, while exposing them for easy automation via a clean,
  consistent DSL-centric command-line interface.

%h2 Why You'd Care

%p
  With SM, thousands of tools, utilities and applications running on your machine become
  incredibly easy to automate and control. You'll find it quite invaluable for website development, too.
%p
  The BDSM project cuts away all the tedious, funky syntax that festoons your
  everyday command-line experience, in favor of a lean, mean Ruby-like
  Domain-Specific Language, just tailor-made for cracking your whip on those
  unruly system management tasks. Short, crisp words of command can convey such
  a tremendously
  %em spine-tingling
  authority, after all.
%p
  So, whether you're just looking for easier ways to run your own personal
  *nix-based machine more efficiently, or whether you're already administering
  dozens, hundreds or
  %em thousands
  of machines at a time with a tool like Puppet or Chef, chances are excellent
  that BDSM will save you major headaches.
%p
  (In the latter case, the abstraction that BDSM painlessly interjects helps to
  seriously de-clutter your Puppet or Chef work - making it easier to get things
  running right in the first place; significantly more portable across execution
  environments; and far easier to maintain. What's not to love, in your own
  intensely personal way?)

%h2 Architecture

%p
  BDSM project itself delivers a robust core framework, with minimal
  prerequisites. You just need GNU coreutils, plus Bash (futire: ZShell).
  (Your distro probably includes these already.)
%p
  One layer up from the framework core, BDSM includes a broad set of "basic" modules,
  which perform a comparable role to the standard run-time loadable libraries
  found in classic programming languages.
%p
  Then, BDSM extensions step up another level, calling the lower-level functions
  provided by the basic modules to implement the specific behaviors (aka actions)
  you'll command, as your scripts interface with the applications and services
  running on your target machine environment.
%p
  Dozens of extensions are in active development by a burgeoning crew of Open
  Source contributors right now, with a diverse selection immediately available
  to get things off to a quite thrilling start.
%p
  And should you find that some critical action you need doesn't exist yet
  (our out-of-the-box goal for 1.0.0 is to have everything at least 90% of people
  want already in there), it's extremely easy to write your own extension.
  Pick any language you like: C, Ruby, Perl, Lua, you name it; if it can spit
  out an executable file that will run in your intended environment, you can use it.

%h2 Creating Extensions

%p
  There are only a few requirements for a BDSM extension:
  %ul
    %li
      All extensions get their own individual directory.
    %li
      Within each extension's main directory (minimally) you'll find a bin/ subdirectory
      %ul
        %li
          with at least one executable file inside, called 'help'.
    %li
      Additionally, in the root of its main directory, every extension needs a
      VERSION text file, complying with semantic versioning convention
      %a{ :href => "http://semver.org/" }
        (http://semver.org/);
      i.e. in the format X.Y.Z, where X,Y & Z are all positive integers.

%p
  The bin/ directory can contain *any* executable file type. So, C-compiled
  binaries, Ruby, python, lua, etc. (not forgetting Shell scripts!) may all be
  used; whatever you prefer.

%h2 Support

%p
  BDSM is continuously and rapidly evolving, thanks to constant community feedback.
  BDSM's core developers (Wayne E. Seguin and Michal Papis) are highly responsive,
  address issues quickly and are fully committed to helping the BDSM community grow.
%br
  (And the community's computers? Waiting breathlessly, attentively, and
  %em above all, obediently;
  ready and eager to leap to fulfill the
  %strong slightest whim
  of their mistresses and masters, of course. :)
