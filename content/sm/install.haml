%h1 Installing the (BD)SM Framework

%p
  You may install either the latest release version; or you can choose the
  latest up-to-the-minute development snapshots as they come, by summoning
  git HEAD.

%h2
  Latest Release

%p
  To install the latest BDSM release, run the following commands in
  your shell:

%pre.code
  :preserve
    version=$(curl https://smf.sh/releases/latest.txt) &&
    curl -O https://smf.sh/releases/sm-${version}.tar.bz2 &&
    tar jxf sm-${version}.tar.bz2 &&
    cd sm-${version} &&
    ./install

%p
  Note: you can skip the first two lines if you prefer to install from your
  current directory.
%p
  The sm framework binaries will be located in /opt/sm/bin/sm and sm itself will
  be entirely contained in /opt/sm/ with the exception of /etc/profile.d/sm.sh
  for adding sm to the path.
%p
  After installing be sure to either source /etc/profile or reopen your terminal
  sessions.

%h2
  Latest Development Snapshot (git HEAD)
%p
  For the latest BDSM development, "live" (git HEAD):
%pre.code
  :preserve
    curl -L https://github.com/sm/sm/tarball/master -o sm-head.tar.gz &&
    tar zxf sm-head.tar.gz &&
    mv sm-sm-* sm-head &&
    cd sm-head &&
    ./install
